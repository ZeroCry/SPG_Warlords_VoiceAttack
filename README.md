# Intro
This requires the game and VoiceAttack be installed to use. Support the developers buy the products. Simply put it lets you controll the game with your voice. Letting you say clear target instead of hitting backspace. It attempts to use all default keys. Though there are some exceptions. 


# Requirements
1. [Starpoint Gemini
    Warlords](http://store.steampowered.com/app/419480/Starpoint_Gemini_Warlords/)
2. [VoiceAttack](http://voiceattack.com) 

Note: Power managment is not assigned keys by default in SPG Warlords. The profile expects the arrow keys relating to the systems **left arrow** for *shields*, **up arrow** for engines, **right arrow** for *weapons*, and **down arrow** *neutral*. Doing that everything else should function properly. 

#### Usage
Edit the profile to see the full list of commands to extensive to really list all of them.
